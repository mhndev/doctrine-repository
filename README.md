# Abstract Doctrine Repository

this package is for whom suffer from working with doctrine like me.
for whom to like working with Eloquent ORM.

this package's intention is to help you to enjoy working with models and repositories and query the database as easy as possible.

### sample usage :

every repository should extend mhndev\doctrineRepository\AbstractDoctrineRepository instead of doctrine Doctrine\ORM\EntityRepository.


 so my UserRepository should look like :

 ```php

 namespace UserBundle\Repository;

 use Abstracts\Repository\AbstractDoctrineRepository;

 /**
  * UserRepository
  *
  * This class was generated by the Doctrine ORM. Add your own custom
  * repository methods below.
  */

 class UserRepository extends AbstractDoctrineRepository
 {

 }


 ```

for example in your action controller you can do the following.
consider that here I have my UserRepository as an dependency in my UserController.


```php

      $userArray = $this->repository->findOneById(1, false);
      $userObject = $this->repository->findOneById(1);

      $users = $this->repository->where('name','ab', 'like')->where('enable', 1)->whereIn('status',['public','private'])->all();

```
